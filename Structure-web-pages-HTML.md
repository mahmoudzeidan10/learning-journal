# Structure Web Pages with HTML
## Process and Design
**in this section we will discusses a process  creating a new website**.First of all you should understand the audience of your site and
        what information they will expect to find on it, so you can ask your self ***Who is the site for?***.  
   So, you should make a survey about your audience and know many information
           about them, in case they are company or individuals.  
           Now when you know your audience you can start with **Site Maps**, you will start to organize the
        information into sections  
        Use WireFrames which is a simple sketch of the information in the site.  
       Design is way of Communication  and Visual hierarchy helps  visitors to understand
            what you are trying to tell them.
        Using Colors and Styles will make more attractive , grouping and sorting will make it more simple.

its structure.**

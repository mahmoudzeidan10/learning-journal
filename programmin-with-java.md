# Programming with JavaScript
**JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly**
  **REACT TO EVENTS**
You can specify that a script should runwhen a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
-  A button is pressed
-  A link is clicked (or tapped) on
-  A cursor hovers over an element
  ## The ABC
- What is script? script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
- To write a script you need to state your goal and then list the tasks need to be completed.

## Some of Expressions and Operators
**RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES**: 
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
2.The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). and we
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name. 
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript
4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases
5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.


### Array  
  **An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.**
 - it is better to use Array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.

- Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold, **like a shopping list**.

## Functions
**Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do.**
  ***Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements***

# Operators and Loops
**Comparison operators**,we can evalute a situwation by comparing one value in the script of what might expected to be.
* == means is equal to, and its compares the value only.
* != means in not equal to
* === means strict equal to, which is compares the value and the data type so they are the same.
* !== means strict not equal.
* there are others like greater than and less than.
## Logical Operators
**this comparision returns single value of true or false**.
  ***so we have three main types of logical operators***:
  * Logical AND && : if there is any false in the comparsion the result will be FALSE.
  * Logical OR || : if there is any True in the comparsion the result will be True.
  * Logical NOT ! : will inverts the vaule.
  ## Loops
  Loops check the condition, if returns true the code block will run, and it will repeats till returns false.
  ## There are three types of loops
  * FOR : When you need to run code a specific number of times, it works like a counter.
  * While : When you dont know how times you need to run the code.
  * Do While: its similar to while loop, but it will run the statment inside the curlu bractice even if the condition evaluates false.
    ### The condition is made up with main statments
    * intialization
    * condition 
    * update

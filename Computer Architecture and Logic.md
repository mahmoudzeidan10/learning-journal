# Computer Architecture and Logic
*** Computers are changing the world**, whether they were in our home , our pucket or any where else.  
## What makes a computer, a computer
tool to solve our problems and help us in the thinking work we do
**thinking machien**,  
so this machhiene would do this:
- take input  
- storage it and 
- make processing then 
- show results **output**.

## Binary and Data
Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones.  
a wire with electricity flowing through it , this single code couuld be on or of and its called a bit.  
so if use more wires you get more bits which means more ones and zeros, **with more bits acomplex information could be represented**.

## Circuits and logic
a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components,which come together to form a circits.  
there is logic gates like and, not and or, which used to make complicated circuits and to perform complex calculations.  

## CPU,Memory,Input and Output
when input done using input devices like mouse and keyboard,there is memory to store information and a CPU where all calculations can be done and finally output devices convert it into physical output.

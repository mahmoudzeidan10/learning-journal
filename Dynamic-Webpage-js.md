# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
Using the document object, you can access and change what content
users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.  

**The document object has**:
- Properties describe characteristics of the current
web page.
- Methods perform tasks associated with the
document currently loaded in the browser.
- Events to respond to.  
All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow.  
## HOW HTML, CSS and Jacascript Fit together
**There are three main languages that are used to create web pages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose**.  
Javascript is like a behavior layer, where we can change how the page behaves and interacting.  
## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
**JavaScript is written as plain text,  like HTML and CSS**  
So, When we want to use JavaScript with a web page, we use the HTML
script element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

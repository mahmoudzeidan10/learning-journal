# Web with CSS
CSS allows to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear,like color background of each element.
## Colors
**The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element.**  
Foreground Color:we can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
- color names
- hex codes
- rgb values  
background color:CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box, We can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways.  
## Understanding Color
**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue**.  
Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels and each color of each pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green and blue.  
## Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.  
**There are three major contrast**:
- Low Contrast:here Text is harder to read and it  affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens specially when they are outside at the sun light.
- High Contrast: Text is easier to read but reading a lot
of text on your page then it can make it harder to read.
- Medium Contrast: its like using dark gray text on a white
background, For reading too much reducing
the contrast a little bit improves readability.  
## CSS3
CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity which is known as RGBA, also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
